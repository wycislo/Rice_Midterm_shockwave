**Background**

●   We are going to access earthquake data from USGS

●   Look for more detailed resources

●   Possible create a timeline 

●   Look at other resources 

●   Japan, Indonesia, USA

 

**Motivation** 

 

Is there an increase in earthquakes since 1970?

Is there an increase in the magnitude of earthquakes since 1970?

 

 

**Questions to answer**

 

●   Plot the earthquake locations

●   Plot magnitudes of the earthquakes 

●   Show the magnitudes compared to location

●   Show collation of earthquakes around the ring of fire

 

 

 

 

**Tools/Modules to use**

●   Python

●   Pandas

●   Matplotlib

●   NumPy

●   SciPy

●   etc.

 

**Data sets to use**

●   USGS - Henry



**Visualizations** 

●   Number of > mag 3 earthquakes vs time - Ali

●   Brake up plots by decade - John / Ali

●   Scatter plots / linear regression - Stan / John / Ali

●   70’s, 80’s,90’s,00’s,10’s - John

●   10 largest earthquakes for each decade – Stan 

●   Show where the max earthquakes are - Stan

●   Map to show where the earthquakes are - Stan 

●   Heat map heat sig is > higher mag then darker the color - Stan

 

**Tasks Breakdown**

\-    Henry: Collect the data. 

\-    Stan / John clean the data

\-    Anderson: Dashboard and project progress.

\-    Ali: Visualization and plotting. 

\-    Ali & Anderson: Presentation and summary.

\-    Maintain github John

\-    Project plan / organize - Henry
